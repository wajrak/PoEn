How To:

1.	Install/run apps both on PC and Android device. 
2.	Set PoE installation path if app has not detected one (it should get it from system registry).
3.	For the first use you want to send out TOKEN from you DEVICE to the PC. Because the token is long as hell, so I’ve added option to share it via email or whatever means you’ve got installed on your device. When you get the TOKEN to the PC PoEn app, paste it into Device Token text box. Keep in mind I had no time to do babysitting code so you need to make sure, ONLY thing you’re pasting is the TOKEN, no white characters or any other characters to be fair. 
4.	Hit start button on the PC PoEn app.
5.	Minimise your phone app, again same reason no time so I have only coded handler for messages received in the background. If you’re looking at the mobile apps interface – you WILL NOT, receive any messages. 
6.	That’s it. You should be receiving messages whenever there is a trade request coming your way, containing brief info about the item and its price. 

Disclaimer: 

Please keep in mind I have did this as a hobby project targeted to cure my lack of time to sit in front of the monitor to wait for trades. It was designed to serve a singular purpose, deliver notification. I know it has a lot of buttons and windows… I got distracted and when I saw easy way to implement some future functionality, I did. Hence inventory mirroring and so many buttons and checkboxes. Yup, these all do something, but I have no wish or will right now to document those, but you’re welcome to play around if you like, other than that you SHOULD not have a need to press anything else than START button.

Will this be developed any further? Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. Sorry but time for dev-fun comes out of my PoE playing time or my sleep time and I like both. Unless there’s an army of wild Exiles knocking on my virtual door this most likely will be it and further update will only happen if it stops working for any reason (keep in mind I am using this daily, so if it breaks, I will fix). 

This was only tested on handful of emulated android devices and one real handset so unless you are using HUAWEI you might be running into some compatibility issues. Sorry but this is how it goes when there’s no test phase.
